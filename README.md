[My Portfolio Site](https://chayadeaver.github.io/chayadeaver/)

I am a software engineer with a background in the food service industry. I always had an interest in tech and was the person my family and friends go to for tech help. The previous jobs I held in food service have given me soft skills that lend itself well to a career as a software engineer. I have a thirst for knowledge and am curious to experiment with new things. I recently finished my training at Flatiron School specializing in software engineering and am looking for opportunities to start my first job as a software engineer.
